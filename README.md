# Watson Chatbot Demo


## Installing and Running

  1. Set `botID`, `XIBMClientID` and `XIBMClientSecret` with their corresponding values in `src/index.js`
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm start`
  4.  open `http://localhost:3030`


### On a side note : 

  1.  I didn't have much time to train my chatbot to respond to all the requests, since I only used a free trial account 
      I was limited to 25 intents at most, so had to make do with whatever I had. 
      
  2. Also I couldn't implement context based chating just yet, since for that I need to have profile documents stored 
      in a Cloudant DB
